		Tries are used to store dictionaries, phone directories, and autocomplete features.

		Binary Tree
		- A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.

		- The height of the tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
		- The depth of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root node to the node.
		- The height of the tree is the height of the root node.
		- The depth of the root node is 0.
		- The height of an empty tree is -1.

		Binary Search Tree (BST)
		- A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent node and the right child is greater than the parent node.
		- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
		- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
		- The left and right subtree must also be a binary search tree.

		Balanced Binary Tree (B-Tree)
		- A binary tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
		- The height of the left and right subtrees of the root node differ by at most one.
		- The left and right subtrees are also balanced binary trees.

		Complete Binary Tree
		- A binary tree where all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.
		- A complete binary tree is a balanced binary tree.

		Full Binary Tree
		- A binary tree where each node has either zero or two children.
		- A full binary tree is a complete binary tree.

		Perfect Binary Tree
		- A binary tree where all internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
		- A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree.

		Traversal
		- Pre-order Traversal: Visit the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
		- In-order Traversal: Visit the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.
		- Post-order Traversal: Visit the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.
		- Level-order Traversal: Visit nodes level by level from left to right.

		Hash Map - Key-Value Pair Data Structure (basicaly a dictionary)
		Usually the complexity to add, remove and find an element is O(1) - constant time.

		The hash function is used to convert the key into an index in the array, since it is in a contiguous memory location, we can access the element in O(1) time complexity.
		The hash functionon probably will be a SHA-256 or MD5, but it can be any function that converts the key into an index in the array.
		A modulo operation is used to ensure that the index (SHA or MD5) is within the array bounds.


		Collision can happen when two keys are converted into the same index, so we need to handle it.
		There are two ways to handle collisions:
		- Open Addressing: When a collision happens, we find the next available index in the array. It is not the best approach because in the worst case scenario we would need to iterate over all elements to find the next available index.
		- Separate Chaining: When a collision happens, we store the elements in a linked list. It is the best approach because we can have multiple elements in the same index, this index will have a linked list with all elements that have the same index.
		Since this sublist its supposed to be small, the time complexity to find an element is O(1).

		Load Factor = Number of elements / Number of buckets. It defines how full the hash map is and it is used to determine when to resize the hash map.
		Keep the load factor below 0.7 to avoid collisions. When the load factor is above 0.7, we need to resize (double) the hash map to avoid collisions.

		Queues are data structres utilized for buffering, task scheduling, data streaming, etc.

		If correct implemented, the queue will maintain an reference to the first(head) and last(tail) element, so we can add and remove elements in O(1) time complexity.
		If we don't have the reference to the last element, we would need to iterate over all elements to find the last element, which would be O(n) time complexity.

		In a dequeue (double linked list), we can add and remove elements from the head and tail - it is not necessarily a FIFO structure.

	/*
			It is not necessary to define the size of the linked list, because each element has a pointer to the next element.

			Types of linked lists:
			- Singly Linked List: Each element has a pointer to the next element.
			- Doubly Linked List: Each element has a pointer to the next and previous element.
			- Circular Linked List: The last element points to the first element and the first element points to the last element.

			Linked List vs Array:
			- Read: Array is faster than Linked List because the elements are allocated in contiguous memory locations. The compplexity to found an element in an array is O(1) and in a linked list is usualy O(n).
			- Insert: Linked List is faster than Array because we don't need to move all elements (basicaly recreate the array) to insert a new element.
			- Delete: Linked List is faster than Array because we don't need to move all elements (basicaly recreate the array) to delete an element.

			Since in array it is in contiguous memory locations, we can calculate the memory address of the element by the index just by using the formula: memory_address = base_address + (index * size_of_element).
			In the linked list, to find it lenght, for example, we need to iterate over all the elements, the same happen to find an specific element.

		 	The scenarios will depend if the changes are in the head/tail or in the middle of the list
			#	Read: O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case
			#	Insert: O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case
			#	Delete: O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case

	   Big O Notation - Measuring Algorithm Performance

	   - Big O notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm, but it does not necessarily represent execution time (performance in terms of speed).
	   - It focuses on how the execution time (or space usage) grows as the input size increases.

	   - Without asymptotic analysis, it’s impossible to determine if an O(n) algorithm is always faster than an O(n²) algorithm.
	     However, we can predict which one will scale better as input size increases.

	   - Big O notation only describes how well an algorithm scales with input size, not how fast it runs in absolute terms.

	   - It is used to measure:
	     - **Time Complexity** (Execution Time)
	     - **Space Complexity** (Memory Usage)

	   O(1) - Constant Time & Constant Space
	   Example: Accessing an array element by index or retrieving the first element of a list.
	   - No matter how large the input is, the execution time remains constant.
	   - Worst-case scenario: execution time does not change with input size.

	   O(log N) - Logarithmic Time
	   Example: Binary Search
	   - As the input size increases exponentially, the execution time increases only linearly.
	   - Each step reduces the problem size significantly (typically by half).

	   O(N) - Linear Time & Linear Space
	   Example: Looping through an array
	   - Execution time grows proportionally with input size.

	   O(N log N) - Linearithmic Time
	   Example: Quick Sort, Merge Sort
	   - The array is divided recursively (O(log N)), and each level of recursion processes all elements (O(N)).
	   - This results in an overall complexity of O(N log N).

	   O(N²) - Quadratic Time
	   Example: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort (Nested loops)
	   - For each element, the algorithm iterates over the entire array again.
	   - Execution time grows quadratically as input size increases.

	   O(2^N) - Exponential Time
	   Example: Recursive Fibonacci Algorithm
	   - Every function call branches into two more calls, leading to an exponential number of recursive calls.
	   - Example: Fibonacci using naive recursion (`fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`).

	   O(N!) - Factorial Time
	   Example: Traveling Salesman Problem (brute force solution)
	   - Worst-case scenario: The algorithm tries **every possible** ordering of N elements.
	   - Example: Finding the shortest route visiting N cities by checking all (N!) permutations.
